Vector databases enable semantic search - searching on the meaning of the text - to provide higher quality results than traditional keyword search. In this project, you'll learn how to use Pinecone, a popular vector database platform, to do this. You'll start by setting up a developer account with Pinecone and integrating it with Workspace, and learn how to "embed text" and import it into Pinecone, before using it for search. You'll also learn about embedding dimensions, distance metrics, and other concepts to control the performance of the results.
